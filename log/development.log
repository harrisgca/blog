[Devise] Could not find devise mapping for path "/login".
This may happen for two reasons:

1) You forgot to wrap your route inside the scope block. For example:

  devise_scope :user do
    get "/some/route" => "some_devise_controller"
  end

2) You are testing a Devise controller bypassing the router.
   If so, you can explicitly tell Devise which mapping to use:

   @request.env["devise.mapping"] = Devise.mappings[:user]

DEPRECATION WARNING: Using #scope without passing a callable object is deprecated. For example `scope :red, where(color: 'red')` should be changed to `scope :red, -> { where(color: 'red') }`. There are numerous gotchas in the former usage and it makes the implementation more complicated and buggy. (If you prefer, you can just define a class method named `self.red`.). (called from <class:Post> at /home/action/workspace/blog/app/models/post.rb:9)
DEPRECATION WARNING: Calling #scope or #default_scope with a hash is deprecated. Please use a lambda containing a scope. E.g. scope :red, -> { where(color: 'red') }. (called from <class:Post> at /home/action/workspace/blog/app/models/post.rb:10)

DEPRECATION WARNING: Using #scope without passing a callable object is deprecated. For example `scope :red, where(color: 'red')` should be changed to `scope :red, -> { where(color: 'red') }`. There are numerous gotchas in the former usage and it makes the implementation more complicated and buggy. (If you prefer, you can just define a class method named `self.red`.). (called from <class:Post> at /home/action/workspace/blog/app/models/post.rb:9)
DEPRECATION WARNING: Calling #scope or #default_scope with a hash is deprecated. Please use a lambda containing a scope. E.g. scope :red, -> { where(color: 'red') }. (called from <class:Post> at /home/action/workspace/blog/app/models/post.rb:10)

Processing by PostsController#index as HTML
DEPRECATION WARNING: Using #scope without passing a callable object is deprecated. For example `scope :red, where(color: 'red')` should be changed to `scope :red, -> { where(color: 'red') }`. There are numerous gotchas in the former usage and it makes the implementation more complicated and buggy. (If you prefer, you can just define a class method named `self.red`.). (called from <class:Post> at /home/action/workspace/blog/app/models/post.rb:9)
DEPRECATION WARNING: Calling #scope or #default_scope with a hash is deprecated. Please use a lambda containing a scope. E.g. scope :red, -> { where(color: 'red') }. (called from <class:Post> at /home/action/workspace/blog/app/models/post.rb:10)
